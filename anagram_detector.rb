# STEP ONE
# Implement your solution below

def detect_anagram(word1, word2)

  #Insert your solution below here.

end


# STEP TWO
# Take what you did in STEP ONE, and create a new method that,
# when called, will still cause the tests bellow to evaluate
# to true, and reduce repetition in your code.

# Place your new function bellow this line.



# DO NOT ALTER ANYTHING BELLOW THIS LINE
