#Find The Anagrams

__Skill Level:__ Beginner  
__Time Limit:__ 15-20 minutes

An anagram is a word, phrase, or sentence formed from another by rearranging its letters: “Angel” is an anagram of “glean.”.

##Instructions
Modify the `detect_anagram` function to detect if the words are anagrams or not.

`detect_anagram('angel', 'glean') should == true`
`detect_anagram('glean', 'angel') should == true`
`detect_anagram('pants', 'pants') should == true`
`detect_anagram('CinEmA', 'iceman') should == true`
`detect_anagram('defgh8', 'g8hefd') should == true`
`detect_anagram('bird', 'house') should == false`
